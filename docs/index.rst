They're are 5 main attributes inside the bloxflip module

- Authorization
- Crash
- Currency
- Mines
- Towers

Example of how you would call the the ``Currency.Balance`` attribute:

>>> from bloxflip import Currency
>>> auth = ""
>>> Currency.Balance(auth)

The auth arguement is optional for many of the functions
Instead you can use the ``bloxflip.Login(auth)`` function once and the functions will automatically use that auth provided. 

You can always change the auth by running ``bloxflip.Login()`` with a different authorization
